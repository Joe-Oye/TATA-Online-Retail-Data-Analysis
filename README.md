# TATA Online Retail Data Analysis
This project was to review a client's (TATA Online Retail business) data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO. Particularly to analyze the major contributing factors to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

## Project Description
I was able to:

- Prepare questions for a meeting with client senior leadership.
- Create visuals for data analysis to help executives with effective decision-making.

## Key Objectives:
### - Extract Insights: 
- Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?
- Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?
- What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?
### - Identify Trends: 
- Analyze the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?
- What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?
- Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?
### - Data Visualization: 
- Created clear and informative visualizations to effectively communicate key findings.
